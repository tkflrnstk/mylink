# Nintendo.com Circa 2001 Console Hardware Design System

## Overview

Nintendo.com circa 2001 is the web rendered as **console hardware**. Where most sites of the era reached for either grunge texture or corporate gradients, this interface builds itself out of **brushed-periwinkle metal plates** — every region is a discrete beveled panel, edge-lit with a brighter highlight on top and a `{colors.chrome-indigo}` shadow line beneath, as if stamped from the same injection-molded plastic as a Game Boy. The whole page reads as one machine faceplate: a body of `{colors.canvas}` periwinkle chrome carrying inset modules, with the corners of the largest panels physically **chamfered** (cut at 45°) rather than rounded, reinforcing the manufactured-object feeling.

The system runs on a tight three-voice contrast. The structural voice is the cool periwinkle-to-indigo chrome (`{colors.canvas}`, `{colors.periwinkle}`, `{colors.chrome-indigo}`). The authority voice is `{colors.carbon}` carbon-navy — the top navigation bar, the right-rail action buttons, and the footer, all near-black slabs printed with a faint **halftone dot-matrix texture** that evokes a speaker grille. The energy voice is warm and reserved for one job only: telling you where to go. `{colors.nav-gold}` lights the primary menu words, `{colors.amber}` fills the utility chips and badges, and `{colors.signal}` orange marks every "forward" cue — the round arrow buttons, the chevron chips beside each headline, the Submit button. Warmth in this system always means *action*; the cool chrome never carries it.

Atmosphere comes from the **hero fields**, which break the periwinkle calm with full-bleed product photography over textured backdrops — a circuit-board cyan on Systems, a motion-blurred racetrack red on Games, a soft lavender wash on Home — each topped with chunky `{typography.display}` wordmarks rendered in white with a heavy outline and hard drop shadow, the visual signature of game-box cover type. A pixel-eared Mario leans in from the masthead with a "Welcome to Nintendo.com!" speech bubble, anchoring the entire machine to the brand's playful character voice.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Every UI region is a **beveled metal plate** in `{colors.canvas}` periwinkle, edge-lit on top and shadow-lined with `{colors.chrome-indigo}` below — the page is assembled, not laid out.
- **Chamfered (cut-corner) panel geometry** on the largest modules; most chrome is sharp-edged (`{rounded.none}`), with rounding reserved for the logo pill, radio dots, and circle-arrow badges (`{rounded.full}`).
- A **carbon-navy command layer** (`{colors.carbon}`) with halftone-dot texture carries the top nav, right-rail buttons, and footer.
- Warmth is rationed as **directional signal only**: `{colors.nav-gold}` for menu words, `{colors.amber}` for utility chips/badges, `{colors.signal}` for every forward/Submit cue.
- **Photographic hero fields** cycle a page-specific accent tint (`{colors.lavender}` home → `{colors.systems-teal}` systems → `{colors.games-red}` games) under outlined `{typography.display}` box-art wordmarks.
- A dense, **modular grid** — masthead, dual nav bars, hero, then a two-thirds content column of stacked list/feature panels beside a one-third right action rail — packed with minimal whitespace.
- **Character-led**: the Mario mascot speech-bubble masthead and ESRB badge frame the chrome with brand personality and regulatory trust marks.

## Colors

The palette is a **cool metallic chassis with rationed warm signal**. Read it as three layers: the periwinkle chrome that everything is built from, the carbon command slabs, and the warm wayfinding accents that are the only saturated color in the steady-state interface.

### Brand & Accent
- **Nintendo Red** (`{colors.primary}` — #e60012): The racetrack logo wordmark and the brand's anchor hue. Used sparingly as pure brand identity and doubled as the validation/alert color. Never a surface fill outside the logo plate.
- **Signal Orange** (`{colors.signal}` — #f68d1f): The "go forward" color. Fills every round arrow button, every chevron chip beside a headline, the Submit button, and the "Play It On" platform badges. If something advances you, it is orange.
- **Amber** (`{colors.amber}` — #ecab37): Utility energy. Fills the Code Bank / Game Finder / Go chips, the info-box header tabs, the sweepstakes stars, and the ESRB Privacy-Certified badge. Distinguished from Signal Orange by being more golden and reserved for *tools and marks* rather than *forward motion*.
- **Nav Gold** (`{colors.nav-gold}` — #e48600): The deeper orange-gold reserved exclusively for the primary navigation words (Games, Systems, News, Nsider, Downloads) glowing on the carbon bar.

### Surface
- **Periwinkle Metallic** (`{colors.canvas}` — #7a8aba): The primary interface body — the brushed-metal chrome that every module is inset into.
- **Light Periwinkle** (`{colors.periwinkle}` — #8ba1d4): Raised mid panels (poll panel, system tiles) — one step brighter than canvas for elevation.
- **Pale Sky** (`{colors.sky}` / `{colors.canvas-soft}` — #9fbee7): The secondary-nav strip and light inset panel fills.
- **Pale Lavender** (`{colors.lavender}` — #acace7): The home hero field and side promo cards.
- **Pale Ice** (`{colors.ice}` — #c0d5e6): The News hero panel field.
- **Chrome Indigo** (`{colors.chrome-indigo}` — #3d4f97): The beveled border / shadow line under every plate, and the leading angled edge of nav tabs.
- **Muted Indigo** (`{colors.muted-indigo}` — #60619c): Inactive tabs and recessed chrome.
- **Platinum Gray** (`{colors.platinum}` — #dedede): The list-row and inset content surface — news headlines and archive rows sit on this cool platinum.
- **White** (`{colors.surface}` — #ffffff): Content cards, form fields, the logo pill, and list-row highlight.

### Text
- **Carbon Navy** (`{colors.ink}` — #21242e): Primary text on light chrome, and the fill of the dark command layer (nav bar, rail buttons, footer).
- **Chrome Indigo** (`{colors.ink-soft}` — #3d4f97): Secondary text and small-caps chrome labels.
- **White** (`{colors.on-primary}` — #ffffff): Text on carbon, red, and orange chrome.

### Semantic
- **Error / Alert** (`{colors.error}` — #e60012): Validation and destructive states reuse the brand red.
- **Systems Teal** (`{colors.systems-teal}` — #206479): Page-accent tint — the Systems hero's circuit-board cyan field.
- **Games Red** (`{colors.games-red}` — #a7282b): Page-accent tint — the Games hero's motion-blurred racetrack field.

## Typography

### Font Family
The era's web-safe reality is **Arial / Helvetica** throughout.

### Hierarchy
- `{typography.display}`: 44px 900
- `{typography.hero-tagline}`: 15px 700
- `{typography.nav-link}`: 13px 700
- `{typography.ui-label}`: 11px 700
- `{typography.link}`: 12px 700
- `{typography.body}`: 12px 400
- `{typography.micro}`: 10px 400

## Layout & Responsive Strategy
- Dual Nav Bars with horizontal scrolling on mobile viewports.
- Stacked single-column reflow for mobile viewports (<768px).
- Rotated left-rail tabs convert to horizontal chip row on mobile viewports.
